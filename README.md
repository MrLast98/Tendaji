# Tendaji

## Description
Tendaji is a simple bot for twitch to address all your bot-sy desired, but locally
It's going to be a full replacement for Streamlabs and Streamelements at some point


## Features
- Full local Application, no third party account
  - Of course, Twitch and Spotify Accounts are necessary
- Everything can be access from https://localhost:5000
- Commands that can be managed from the https://localhost:5000/commands page
  - Simple commands
    - Can add them, modify role, enable/disable them
  - Complex commands
    - Can only modify role and enable/disable them, code required
- Spotify support for query and link song request
- Events logging (ONLY FOLLOW SUPPORTED FOR NOW)
- Local AI Toxicity Analysis (No Chat-GPT)
- Pre-configured text replacements

## Specification
All permission are based on the following hierarchy:
```
'BROADCASTER' > 'MOD' > 'VIP' > 'SUB' > 'ANY' 
```
Setting up a specific level will make the command available to any higher level, so a VIP can bypass SUB and ANY
